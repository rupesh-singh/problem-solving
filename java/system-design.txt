System Design:
-Replication
-Consistency
-Sharding
-Partition tolerant


CAP Theorem
-Consistency
-Availability
-Partition Tolerant


Design Cache:
    -Type of Caching System
        -Write Through Cache: Write to cache and DB (2 Write Operation): Costly
        -Write Around Cache: Write to DB. Cache System reads from DB incase of miss: 
        -Write back Cache: Write to Cache. Cache will asyncronly Write to DB. (Might let to loss of Data)

Problem Approach:
    - feature Extraction: Main goal of the system Suggested.
    - Estimation: Decide how scalable our system should be. QPS (Query / Secoond) Comes handy.
    - Design Goals: Can be many but most common (Latency, Availability, Consistency)
    - Deep Dive: Discuss in Detail
